## **First `sudo`**

### **What is `sudo`?**
- **`sudo` (Superuser Do)** allows a user to execute commands as another user, typically as the **root (administrator) user**.
- It is used to **elevate privileges** for tasks that require administrative access, such as installing software, modifying system files, or changing configurations.

### **Why is `sudo` important?**
- Unlike **Windows administrator accounts**, Linux operates under the **principle of least privilege**â€”regular users do not have unrestricted access to system-critical files.
- **Using `sudo` instead of logging in as root** prevents accidental system-wide damage and improves security.

### **Basic Usage of `sudo`**
```sh
sudo command
```
- Example: Update package lists
  ```sh
  sudo apt update
  ```
- Example: Restart a service
  ```sh
  sudo systemctl restart apache2
  ```

### **Checking and Managing `sudo` Permissions**
- **List who has `sudo` access**:
  ```sh
  getent group sudo  # On Ubuntu/Debian-based systems
  getent group wheel  # On RHEL/CentOS-based systems
  ```
- **Add a user to the `sudo` group** (Requires root access):
  ```sh
  sudo usermod -aG sudo username  # Ubuntu/Debian
  sudo usermod -aG wheel username  # RHEL/CentOS
  ```
- **Check which commands a user can run with `sudo`**:
  ```sh
  sudo -l
  ```

### **Best Practices for Using `sudo` Securely**
- **Do not use `sudo` for every command unnecessarily.**
- **Never execute untrusted scripts with `sudo`.**
- **Use `sudo -i` or `sudo su` carefully**, as it provides a root shell, which can be risky.
- **Monitor sudo usage** with logs:
  ```sh
  sudo cat /var/log/auth.log | grep sudo  # Debian/Ubuntu
  sudo cat /var/log/secure | grep sudo  # RHEL/CentOS
  ```

## **1. Terminal**
- **What is a terminal?**
  - A command-line interface (CLI) used to interact with Linux.
  - More powerful and efficient than a graphical interface for many tasks.
- **How to open the terminal?**
  - **Ubuntu/Linux Mint:** `Ctrl + Alt + T`
  - **CentOS/RHEL:** Applications > Terminal
  - **Arch-based distros:** Open via menu or shortcut
